# CommDevTransit
A Mapbox-powered exploration of economic opportunity and access to public transportation in Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem &amp; the Bronx — where mobility meets momentum.

NYC Housing & Transit Development Map is an interactive tool designed to explore the intersection of community development opportunities and access to public transit in New York City. This project was created to support more equitable urban planning by visualizing where housing investments are occurring in relation to key transportation infrastructure. By mapping this relationship, the project aims to highlight areas where development may support—or lack—transit accessibility, helping inform future decisions by planners, policymakers, and advocates focused on equitable growth.

The data powering this map comes from publicly available JSON datasets provided by the NYC Department of City Planning. These include zoning, land use, and housing development information, which have been layered onto an interactive map to allow users to search specific addresses and understand the spatial distribution of development patterns across the five boroughs.

Technically, the project was built using Mapbox GL JS to render the map and display geo-spatial data with precision and clarity. HTML and CSS were used to create the interface, customize the map design, and enable features such as the search bar and responsive layout. The ultimate goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that makes complex urban data more accessible, while also encouraging more nuanced conversations about where housing investments align with public transit access—and where gaps remain.
